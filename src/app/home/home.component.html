		<h3>How does it work</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Your phone is registered when you buy it or opt in.</p></li>
			<li><p>If your phone is ever stolen, you can log into Identiphone to retrieve your IMEI number and with this number you can ring your network provider to block your phone</p></li>
			<li><p>It also enables you to check the history of a phone. So you can see if a phone has been stolen or the number of previous owners it has had</p></li>		
			<li><p>For retailers or people buying second hand phones it can provide clarity that you are buying from the actual owner of the phone</p></li>
		</ul>
